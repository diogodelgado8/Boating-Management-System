# Boating-Management-System
A Boating Management System created from scratch using PostgreSQL. Project developed for the Information Systems and Databases course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

Group project developed over the course of a couple of weeks with my colleagues Mariana Lima and Madalena Fernandes.

The project is divided into 3 parts, each one with different deliverables. The several parts of this project should be considered INDEPENDENT of one another.

Part 1: From written specifications about the system, creation of an Entity-Association model diagram for the Boating management system.

Part 2: From a given Entity-Association model, translation into SQL, populating the database and simple querying of the database.

Part 3: Given the schema for the database, creation of Stored Procedures and Triggers to comply with integrity constraints, complex querying, views and indexes. 
        Creation of a simple web application for easier management of the database (.cgi files).
